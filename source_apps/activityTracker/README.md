# C++ Activity Tracker

This is about to replace activity_tracker_win as this project uses VCPKG to install third party libraries such as curl.

To install needed packages, open Visual Studio > Tools > Command Line > Developer Command Prompt

Run: `vcpkg install`

## Current problem: Curl is successfully installed, yet it cannot be imported. (not resolved yet)
