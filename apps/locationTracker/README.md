# Location Tracker App

For a very detailed and thorough description of the app, including the flow from the first opening of it, please consult this custom [this documentation](https://marekstef.github.io/storage-system-documentation/docs/example-apps/location-tracker/walkthrough). We highly recommend reading it before diving into the app's source code. If the link to the documentation does not work for some reason, the whole documentation project resides at the root of this main repository.

This Android Kotlin Application is part of the bachelor project - Decentralised Data Storage.
