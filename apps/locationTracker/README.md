# Location Tracker App

For a very detailed and thorough description of the app, including the flow from the first opening of it, please consult this custom [this documentation](https://marekstef.github.io/storage-system-documentation/docs/example-apps/location-tracker/walkthrough). We highly recommend reading it before diving into the app's source code. If the link to the documentation does not work for some reason, the whole documentation project resides at the root of this main repository.

This Android Kotlin Application is part of the bachelor project - Decentralised Data Storage.

## Obtaining compiled binaries

If you don't want to set up the whole project but want to start the application, look at the Release page in this Github repository where you should find compiled binaries along with requirements.

## Setting Up And Building the Project

### Preqrequisites

- **Android Studio Jellyfish 2023 or later** Ensure you have Android Studio installed

Now, open Android Studio and inside, open `Virtual Device Manager`. For our project, we recommend installing `Pixel 8 Pro API 34 with Google Play`. The release name of the OS should be `UpsideDownCake`.

All you need to do now is to open this project and build it in the studio. Emulator should be automatically started and after a while, this application should be installed automatically and opened.
