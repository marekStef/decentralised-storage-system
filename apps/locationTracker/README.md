# Location Tracker App

This Android Kotlin Application is part of the bachelor project - Decentralised Data Storage.

For a very detailed and thorough description of the app, including the flow from the first opening of it, please consult this custom [documentation](https://marekstef.github.io/storageSystemDocs/docs/example-apps/location-tracker/walkthrough). We highly recommend reading it before diving into the app's source code.
