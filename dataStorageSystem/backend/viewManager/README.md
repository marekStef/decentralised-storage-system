# View Manager

This component is responsible for managing `View Templates`. To read more about this component, please consult [this](https://marekstef.github.io/storage-system-documentation/docs/main-system/view-manager/introduction) documentation which contains significantly more information about it. If the link to the documentation does not work for some reason, the whole documentation project resides at the root of this main repository.

## Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

In the `.env` file, execution services like `JAVASCRIPT_EXECUTION_SERVICE_URI` and `PYTHON_EXECUTION_SERVICE_URI` need to be correctly set for a View Manager to be fully functional. `MONGO_DB_URI` needs to be set as well.

Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```
