# View Manager

## Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

In the `.env` file, execution services like `JAVASCRIPT_EXECUTION_SERVICE_URI` and `PYTHON_EXECUTION_SERVICE_URI` need to be correctly set for a View Manager to be fully functional. `MONGO_DB_URI` needs to be set as well.

Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```
