# Introduction

`Python Execution Service` is intended to be used by `View Manager` component to execute custom defined python source code. It has been designed as a general code execution component and does not feature any `View Manager`'s related logic. This allows the component to be used by future newly added concepts in the system.

:::caution

Before you can utilise this component, you must understand the requirements on the source code. Therefore, you are obliged to read [this](./requirements-on-source-code) before continuing your reading of `Python Execution Service`.
