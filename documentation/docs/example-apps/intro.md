# Demo Applications

Throughout the Proof of Concept (PoC) phase, we concurrently developed example applications to evaluate the capabilities of the system. This concurrent development proved to be highly advantageous, as it helped us refine our decentralised storage system's backend architecture.

We implemented three applications, each designed to demonstrate a unique use case scenario. At this moment we expect the main storage system running and accessible on some network with a known IP address and a port.
