# New App Setup

### Registering a new App Holder *(admin part)*

`Auth Service` is responsible for creating new `app holders`. These can be understood as some handles for the apps.

To create a new holder, a request to **/admin/api/registerNewApp** *(POST)* needs to be made.

Request body should look like this:

```js
{
    "nameDefinedByUser": "My New App"
}
```

and response is either successful (201 - created or 409 - conflict):

```js title="201 response"
{
    "message": "Application registered successfully.",
    "appHolderId": "65fae0947a90b4a5263a4980"
}
```

```js title="409 response"
{
    "message": "An application with this name defined by user already exists."
}
```

### Getting association token for App Holder *(admin part)*

After the `app holder` is created, the app which the holder was created for needs to be associated. That's why `Auth Service` has an endpoint for generating `Authorisation Token`. When the new app associates itself with the provided token, it also appends its unique name to the association request. Unique name can be for instance a website domain.

After you have an `appHolderId` acquired from above, you can hit **/admin/api/generateOneTimeAssociationToken** *(POST)* request.

Body of that request needs to contain `appHolderId`:

```js title="body of /admin/api/generateOneTimeAssociationToken"
{
    "appHolderId": "65f85d8f72d3cb5a148a96f6"
}
```

There are three possible outcomes:

```js title="201 (created) response"
{
    "message": "One-time association token generated successfully",
    "tokenId": "65fae1747a90b4a5263a4984"
}
```

Second outcome, when the app has already been associated before hitting this endpoint:

```js title="400 response"
{
    "message": "Application has already been associated"
}
```

Or when the id does not exist and was not created:

```js title="404 response"
{
    "message": "Application not found"
}
```

### Associating app with the App Holder using `appHolderId` *(application part)*

```js
{
    "associationTokenId": "65fae1747a90b4a5263a4984",
    "nameDefinedByApp": "application.com"
}
```

After the app is successfully associated, `associationTokenId` is invalidated.

Again, there are multiple kinds of responses:

```js title="200 response"
{
    "message": "App successfully associated with the storage app holder",
    "app": {
        "_id": "65fae0947a90b4a5263a4980",
        "nameDefinedByUser": "My New Application",
        "dateOfAssociationByApp": "2024-03-20T13:18:33.472Z",
        "jwtTokenForPermissionRequestsAndProfiles": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhcHBJZCI6IjY1ZmFlMDk0N2E5MGI0YTUyNjNhNDk4MCIsIm5hbWVEZWZpbmVkQnlVc2VyIjoiTXkgTmV3IEFwcGxpY2F0aW9uIiwibmFtZURlZmluZWRCeUFwcCI6ImFwcGxpY2F0aW9uLmNvbSIsImlhdCI6MTcxMDk0MDcxMywiZXhwIjoxMTE3ODIyMDcxM30.3zHTC0_igQKfzjF8uZadJLkmd4qRXY_hePd_M6pmPj0",
        "dateOfRegistration": "2024-03-20T13:11:48.132Z",
        "__v": 0,
        "nameDefinedByApp": "application.com"
    },
    "jwtTokenForPermissionRequestsAndProfiles": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhcHBJZCI6IjY1ZmFlMDk0N2E5MGI0YTUyNjNhNDk4MCIsIm5hbWVEZWZpbmVkQnlVc2VyIjoiTXkgTmV3IEFwcGxpY2F0aW9uIiwibmFtZURlZmluZWRCeUFwcCI6ImFwcGxpY2F0aW9uLmNvbSIsImlhdCI6MTcxMDk0MDcxMywiZXhwIjoxMTE3ODIyMDcxM30.3zHTC0_igQKfzjF8uZadJLkmd4qRXY_hePd_M6pmPj0"
}
```

:::caution

Your app needs to remember `jwtTokenForPermissionRequestsAndProfiles` from this resposne as it will be useful for profiles and requesting permissions.

Or there is a wrong response:

```js title="400 response"
{
    "message": "Invalid association token"
}
```

Congratulations! Your app is now ready! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
