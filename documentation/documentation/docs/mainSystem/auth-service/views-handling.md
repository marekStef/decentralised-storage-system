# Views Handling

:::note

`View Templates` and `View Instances` are trully being handled by `View Manager` component. `Auth Service` only checks whether the app is authorised to use given `View Instance` and then delegates this request to `View Manager` component. To know more about it, head there, please.

:::

## Registering New View Instance

- **/app/api/registerNewViewInstance** *(POST)*

```js title=""
```

## Running View Instance

- **/app/api/runViewInstance** *(POST)*

```js title=""
```

Congratulations! You have now covered most of the `Auth Service` component functionality! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
