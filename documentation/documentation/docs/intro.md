# Introduction

Welcome to the dataStorage project.

### Why

The reason this project exists is simply because there is unlimited amount of information being constantly gathered around us.

The only problem is that the data do not belong to us but rather to the companies gathering it. This leads to the creation of large data silos.

However, it wasn't meant to be like this. Data should belong to users. Hence, this project.

This project consists of a decentralised system used for storing data events, manipulating them, authorisation and so on.
