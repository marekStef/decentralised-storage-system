# Data Storage System

The documentation for the entire project can be found [here](./documentation) and is hosted on [this page](https://marekstef.github.io/storage-system-documentation/).

We highly recommend reading the aforementioned documentation which contains significantly more information. READMEs in this project aim to be simplistic, giving you only a brief overview and setup instructions. To see a bigger view, please head over to those docs.

If the hosted documentation is not accessible ( due to hosting or other problems ), it's also [here](./documentation). Documentation itself is a React application and therefore, if the link to the hosted one works, there's no need to setup this one.

Setup Instructions:
1. Setup of the [main data storage system](./dataStorageSystem)
More about the main data storage system [here in docs](https://marekstef.github.io/storage-system-documentation/docs/category/introduction).

2. Setup of the [individual source apps](./apps)
More about the individual applications highlighting the features of this system [here in docs](https://marekstef.github.io/storage-system-documentation/docs/example-apps/intro).
